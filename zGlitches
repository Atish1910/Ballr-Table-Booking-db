Front End Glitches 
01 : Logout Button is not working Properly
02 : if user deactivate user user cant be logged in always check from DB user isActive field is true or false if its false user cant be loggedin
03 : Currently if user refresh page after loggedin in mobile page not working , user need to redirect again on page then it will display

Front End Formatting Properly As Per Component
-> each section component is diffrent  There should be 7 Components
SectionOne.jsx => Console Section :  6Tables (D1 to D6)
SectionTwo.jsx => Expensive VIP Section :  12Tables (t1 To t4, E1 to E8)
SectionThree.jsx => Top Right T Sectiom :  6Tables (T1 to T6)
SectionFour.jsx => Top Left S Sectiom :  6Tables (S1 to S6)
SectionFive.jsx => SD Lounge K Section : 10Tables (S7 To S10, K1 to K4, k5 & k6)
SectionSix.jsx => Floor Left Section (f19 to f31) 
SectionSeven.jsx => Floor Right Section (f1 to f18)


Front End Feature Needs To Add
01 : There Should be max 2 Admin in loggedin not more than that after if user try to Register as admin it cant
02 : Forget Password functanility need to add
